its a python code for making the bot to read your pdf

for using this you need to install kivy and kivymd 
for proper installation refer the document file
for making your document to read 
put your pdf file ,python code and .kv file in same folder
remember you have to give input to gui's 1 st textfield with .pdf extension 
in my case it was filename.pdf 
you have to give input to gui's 2 st textfield with page number from where you want the bot to study

have fun with coding.....
